## 1. Introduction

Chinese is a language with an exceptionally long recorded history. Consequently, periodization is essential for its study. In this post, I will summarize how the stages of the Chinese language are categorized, primarily from a phonological perspective.

## 2. Karlgren

The Swedish sinologist __Bernhard Karlgren__ [ˈbæːɳaɖ ˈkɑːɭɡreːn] (1889–1978), in his monumental work ___Études sur la phonologie chinoise___ [_Studies on Chinese Phonology_] (1915-1926), divided the history of Chinese into five stages:

- **Proto-chinois [Proto-Chinese]**: The stage preceding the earliest attested documents.
    
- **Chinois archaïque [Archaic Chinese]**: The language of the _Shījīng_ 《詩經》 [_Book of Odes_].
    
- **Ancien chinois [Ancient Chinese]**: The language between 500 and 600 CE reflected in the _Qièyùn_ Series rime dictionaries [_Qièyùn_ xì yùnshū] 《切韻》系韻書 such as the _Guǎngyùn_ (GY)《廣韻》 [_Broad Rimes_] (1008).
    
- **Chinois moyen [Middle Chinese]**: The language reflected in the rime tables compiled during the Sòng 宋 dynasty (960-1279).
    
- **Vieux mandarin [Old/Early Mandarin]**: The language of the _Hóngwù zhèngyùn_ 《洪武正韻》(1375).
    

Today, Karlgren's "chinois archaïque/Archaic Chinese" and "ancien chinois/Ancient Chinese" have generally been replaced by the more conventional terms __Old Chinese (OC)__ and __Middle Chinese (MC)__, respectively. These newer terms are much closer to the usual Chinese terms for these two periods, __shànggǔ hànyǔ 上古漢語__ and __zhōnggǔ hànyǔ 中古漢語__.
Furthermore, Karlgren’s "chinois moyen/Middle Chinese" is no longer considered a discrete stage; it is typically grouped with "ancien chinois/Ancient Chinese" under the umbrella of Middle Chinese. Early Mandarin is now more commonly represented by the ___Zhōngyuán yīnyùn___ __《中原音韻》__ [_Rimes of the Central Plain_] (1324) by Zhōu Déqīng 周德清.

## 3. Pulleyblank

Research into MC pronunciation traditionally used the ___Qièyùn___ __(QY)__ by Lù Fǎyán 陸法言 as its starting point. Rime tables, such as the ___Yùnjìng___ __《韻鏡》__ [_Mirror of Rimes_] and ___Qīyīn lüè___ __《七音略》__ [_Outline of the Seven Sounds_], were used as keys to unlock the phonological system of the QY.

The Canadian sinologist __Edwin Pulleyblank__ (1922-2013) refined this by dividing MC into two distinct periods:

- **Early Middle Chinese (EMC)**: The "early standard language" of the Northern and Southern dynasties (420-589) [Nán běi cháo] 南北朝 underlying the QY-GY.
    
- **Late Middle Chinese (LMC)**: The "late standard language" of the Táng 唐 dynasty (618-907) reflected in the rime tables.
    
Pulleyblank's first LMC reconstruction was published in 1970–1971. His EMC and refined versions of LMC are provided in his major works: ___Middle Chinese: A Study in Historical Phonology___ (1984) and ___Lexicon of Reconstructed Pronunciation in Early Middle Chinese, Late Middle Chinese and Early Mandarin___ (1991).

TABLE 3.1 A comparison between Pulleyblank's (1991) EMC and LMC
|                      | EMC   | LMC      | Mand.           |
| -------------------- | ----- | -------- | --------------- |
| 非 'is not'           | puj   | fjyj/fji | fēi [fej⁵⁵]    |
| 定 'make fixed'       | dɛjŋʰ | tɦiajŋˋ  | dìng [tiŋ⁵¹]   |
| 章 'display' | tɕɨaŋ | tʂiaŋ    | zhāng [tʂɑŋ⁵⁵] |
| 日 'sun'              | ɲit   | rit      | rì [ɻɻ̩⁵¹]     |

## 4. Zhèngzhāng

Like MC, OC can be further divided into several sub-periods. The Chinese scholar __Zhèngzhāng Shàngfàng 鄭張尚芳__ (1933-2018) proposed a tripartite division (鄭張 2003/2013):

- **shànggǔ qiánqī 上古前期 [Early Old Chinese]**: The language of oracle bone and Early Western Zhōu bronze inscriptions (c. 14th–9th cent. BCE).
    
- **shànggǔ zhōngqī 上古中期 [Middle Old Chinese]**: Pre-Qín texts and inscriptions from the Mid-Western Zhōu onwards (c. 8th–3rd cent. BCE).
    
- **shànggǔ hòuqī 上古後期 [Late Old Chinese]**: Late Qín, Hàn, and Wèi foreign transcriptions (c. 2nd cent. BCE–3rd cent. CE).
    

However, some scholars (Baxter 1992, Baxter–Sagart 2014) argue that the Western distinction between __"old" (attested in earliest documents)__ and __"proto-" (unattested, reconstructed stage)__ is difficult to apply to Chinese. Because the oldest texts are not "attested" in the same phonetic sense as Latin, they must be reconstructed similarly to a "proto-" language, making the distinction between Old Chinese and Proto-Chinese (= Proto-Sinitic) difficult to define meaningfully at this stage.

## 5. Conclusion

I generally categorize the periodization of Chinese as follows. While there are transitional periods (such as the Wèi-Jìn 魏晉 period between OC and MC discussed by __Ting Pang-hsin__ [Dīng Bāngxīn] __丁邦新__ (Ting 1975), or the transition between MC and EM), they are omitted here for simplicity.
