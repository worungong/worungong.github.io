# Welcome to Mouchengzhai
The name of this blog, __Móuchéngzhāi__ [mow³⁵ tʂʰəŋ³⁵ dʐaj⁵⁵] is pronounced roughly like _moh-chung-jai_, with the first two syllables rising in pitch like asking "oh? huh?", and the last syllable held high and steady, like a musical sol. __zhāi__ ryhmes with "try".
__Mouchengzhai 謀成齋__ “the Studio of Planning and Success.” encapsulates a Confucian principle: true success arises from caution and planning, not from impulsive heroism. This idea is articulated clearly in the following passage from _Lúnyǔ_ 《論語》 [_The Analects of Confucius_], Book VII _Shù Ér_ 述而:

>__子曰：「暴虎馮河，死而無悔者，吾不與也。必也臨事而懼，好謀而成者也。」__\
The Master said, "Someone who fights a tiger bare-handed or wades the Yellow River, and is willing to die without regret—I would not take such a person with me. If I must choose, then I would take someone who approaches affairs with fearful caution, who likes to plan carefully and thereby succeeds."

# About the owner
I am __Worungong 월운공__ [wʌ̹.ɾun.goŋ] (roughly _wuh-roon-gong_) from Korea. My nickname (or pen name) comes from the Sino-Korean reading of __月雲公__ (Middle Chinese: _ŋwjʌt.ɦjun.kuwŋ_), where __月雲__ means "Moon Cloud" and __公__ is an honorific for a man (corresponding to English "Mr."), which can be omitted. Feel free to just call me __Worun 월운__.
I'm currently studying Chinese Historical Linguistics in Seoul. My posts are likely to talk about:

* Occasional journal entries
* Spontaneous thoughts
* Quotes from my reading
* Updates and corrections to my published works
