"There is a tendency among modern linguists to ride this hobbyhorse so blindly as to reduce their efforts to an intellectual sport — to write a given language with as few simple letters as possible, preferably no other than those to be found on an American typewriter. This modern trend in linguistics has unduly simplified and thereby distorted the real character of the languages so studied."

— Bernhard Karlgren, "Compendium of Phonetics in Ancient and Archaic Chinese", _Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities_, 1954, p. 366.
