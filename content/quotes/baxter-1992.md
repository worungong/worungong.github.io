"In this typable version of the transcription [for Middle Chinese], all the symbols used have strandard ASCII codes, and can be used in any standard word-processing or database software. We may wish for a day when the computer world agrees on a standard way to handle diacritics and phonetic symbols, but that day has not yet come; until it does, the desire to use only symbols found on an American typewriter, though ridiculed by Karlgren, deserves to be taken seriously in desigining a practical transcription system."

— William Baxter, _A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology_, 1992, p. 30.
